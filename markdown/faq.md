# Frequently Asked Questions

### Can Last4El add a package for {software}?

It depends.  Last4El is not a general purpose repository.  It has the limited scope
of only providing newer versions of packages already in RHEL.  If the software
in question is not packaged in RHEL, then it is eligible to be submitted to the
[EPEL][epel] (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository, and is out of
scope for Last4El.  If the software is packaged in RHEL (or EPEL) but is an older
version, it may be a good fit for Last4El.  You can open a new package request on
our [wishlist][wishlist].
