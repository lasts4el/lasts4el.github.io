# Package Signing Keys

All Lasts4El packages will be signed with a GPG signature.  By default, yum will verify
these signatures and refuse to install any packages that are not signed or have
bad signatures.  These signatures ensure that the packages you install are what
was produced by the Lasts4El Project and have not been altered (accidentally or
maliciously) by any mirror or website that is providing the packages.
